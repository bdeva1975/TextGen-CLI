# OpenAI Text Response CLI Tool

This Python script allows you to interact with OpenAI's API via command-line inputs, where you can provide a model and input text to receive a generated response. It uses the `openai` library and environment variables for secure API key management.

## Features
- Communicates with OpenAI's models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`) via API.
- Accepts model and input content as command-line arguments.
- Handles up to 2000 tokens per response.
- Flexible parameters for response generation (temperature, top_p).

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `openai`
  - `python-dotenv`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**:
   In the project directory, create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

   To use the script, pass the desired OpenAI model and input content as command-line arguments:
   ```bash
   python script.py <model_name> "<input_text>"
   ```

   For example:
   ```bash
   python script.py gpt-3.5-turbo "What is the capital of France?"
   ```

2. **Response**:

   The script will return the response generated by the OpenAI model based on the input text:
   ```
   Paris is the capital of France.
   ```

## Customization

- **Model**: You can specify any OpenAI model, such as `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- **Max Tokens**: You can adjust the maximum number of tokens returned by modifying the `max_tokens` argument in the script.
- **Temperature & Top P**: You can control the randomness of the responses by tweaking the `temperature` and `top_p` parameters in the script.
